### Model Architecture

A **custom CNN architecture** was implemented using TensorFlow/Keras, consisting of multiple convolutional, pooling, and dense layers.  
The model was trained from scratch on chest X-ray images without using pre-trained models such as VGG, ResNet, or Inception.


#### Dataset

This project uses the **Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)** dataset from Kaggle:
